# Atlas – Habit Engine

Purpose: track a small set of **core habits** and keep their logic clear,
without turning this into a giant tracker.

---

## 1. Principles

- Fewer habits, done consistently > many habits, abandoned in 2 weeks.
- Focus on habits that:
  - support health & energy,
  - support learning (coding, English),
  - support financial discipline.

---

## 2. Core habits (example list – edit freely)

- Physical therapy sessions
- Short daily coding practice or reading
- Weekly financial review
- Sleep routine (go to bed at roughly the same time)

---

## 3. Habit definition template

For each habit:

### Habit: [Name]

- Why it matters:
- Minimum version (on “bad” days):
- Ideal version (on “good” days):
- When/where:
- Tracking method (if any):

---

## 4. Example

### Habit: Physical therapy – feet/knees/pelvis

- Why it matters: base for long-term mobility and comfort.
- Minimum version: 5–10 minutes of basic exercises.
- Ideal version: 25–30 minutes structured routine.
- When/where: at home, preferably evening.
- Tracking: simple checkbox in another app/document; no need to store raw logs here.
