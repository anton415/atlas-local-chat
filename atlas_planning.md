# Atlas – Planning Engine

Purpose: a lightweight system for **daily / weekly / monthly planning**
that stays connected to the Temple of Excellence and my projects.

---

## 1. Levels of planning

- **Daily** – What 3 things matter today?
- **Weekly** – What are the 3–5 outcomes for this week?
- **Monthly / Quarterly** – Which domains/projects get focus?

---

## 2. Daily planning template

### Today: [YYYY-MM-DD]

1. Big rocks (max 3):
   - [ ]

2. Supportive habits:

   - [ ] Finance check (if planned)
3. Energy note:

## 4. Connection to other files

- Long-term directions → `Temple_of_Excellence` docs.

- Emotional patterns → `atlas_emotional_timeline.md`.
- Use planning engine to **pull from** those, not duplicate everything.
