# Atlas – Emotional Timeline

Purpose: keep a **high-level map** of my emotional state over months/years,
so I can see patterns without writing a full diary here.

---

## How to use

- Log only **big shifts** or **longer trends**, not every mood change.
- Each entry:
  - date (or date range),
  - short description of emotional pattern,
  - main triggers,
  - what helped / what made it worse.

## Template

### [YYYY-MM-DD] – [YYYY-MM-DD] – Emotional headline

- Triggers / context:
- Helpful responses:
- Lessons / what I want to remember:

## Example

### [2025-11-15] – [2025-11-30] – After reading dark fiction

- Pattern: mix of fascination and emotional heaviness; occasional fear/unease.
- Triggers: very dark control/BDSM books.
- Helpful:
  - grounding in reality (“this is fiction, not my life”),
  - fresh air, work focus, gentle movies.
- Lesson: dark reading is okay but I need recovery rituals afterwards.
