# Finance – Project Memory

This file stores long-term memory for my **personal finance & FIRE** project.

---

## 1. Project identity

- Purpose:
  - Design a realistic path to financial independence (FIRE).
  - Maintain investment strategy, portfolio structure, and big money decisions.
- Tools:
  - Apple Numbers (Budget, Investment Ladder, Portfolio).
  - Simple rules and checklists instead of over-complicated models.

---

## 2. Key targets & constraints

- FIRE target: ~340k RUB/month passive income.
- Approach:
  - Combine deposits, bonds, and other instruments realistically available in my situation.
  - Focus on safety first, especially given sanctions and local market specifics.
- Savings behavior:
  - Aim: at least 30% of income goes to saving/investing.
  - Flexibly adapt during very good / very bad months, but keep annual target.

## 3. Strategy snapshot (example – adjust numbers if needed)

- Core portfolio idea:
  - X% cash buffer
  - Y% deposits (high & reliable interest rates)
  - Z% bonds (OFZ + quality corporates)
  - Small portion for higher-risk experiments
- Time horizon: decades, not years.
