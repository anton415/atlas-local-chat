# Atlas – Emotion Protocol

Purpose: a **simple protocol** for when emotions are strong or unstable,
so I don’t need to reinvent the wheel each time.

---

## Step 1 – Name & rate

- Name what I feel (e.g. fear, sadness, anger, shame, numbness).
- Rate intensity 1–10.
- Write 1–2 sentences describing the situation.

---

## Step 2 – Ground in the present

Options (choose 1–3):

- 5 deep slow breaths, counting exhales.
- Look around and name:
  - 5 things I see,
  - 4 things I can touch,
  - 3 things I can hear,
  - 2 things I can smell,
  - 1 thing I can taste.
- Brief reminder: “This is a feeling, not a command. I am still safe right now.”

---

## Step 3 – Gentle self-talk

Example scripts Atlas can use:

- “It makes sense you feel this way after X. You’re not broken.”
- “You don’t need to solve your whole life right now, just the next tiny step.”
- “You can pause. You’re allowed to rest and then come back.”

---

## Step 4 – Choose one tiny action

Depending on the situation:

- Move: short walk, stretch, or simple physical exercise.
- Soothe: tea, warm bath, calm music, safe movie.
- Organize: brain-dump in a journal, or make a very small plan.
- Reach out: write to a friend/therapist (if relevant).

## Step 5 – Optional short note

If the event feels important long-term, add a short entry to:

- `atlas_emotional_timeline.md` (high-level pattern), or
- `memory_inbox.md` (raw details to process later).

The goal is to **reduce chaos**, not to analyze everything immediately.
