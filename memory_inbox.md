# Atlas – Memory Inbox

Use this file as a RAW DUMP.

- Capture short notes after sessions with Atlas, reading, or reflections.
- Once per week, review everything here and move important pieces into:
  - `atlas_memory_core.md`, or
  - `atlas_memory_projects.md`, or
  - the relevant `projects/<Project>/memory.md`
- Delete or compress what you no longer need.
